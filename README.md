# Ots_COQR_2023
## Objective: Use GT-seq to to evaluate genetic diversity between NOR and HOR Chinook salmon sampled at Bandon Hatchery on the Coquille River, Oregon.
## Sampling: 312 fin clips (44 presumed NOR, 267 presumed HOR, 1 unknown origin) were sampled October - December 2023.
## Genotyped with the SFGL GT-seq SOP, XX probe seq file, and OtsSEX_test_v3.pl. Quality filtered according to SFGL SOP.
## metadata: SFGL intake form
## GT-seq_genotyping_output: initial outputs from GT-seq genotyping. marker info file and original genotypes.
## filtering_record_filtered_genotypes: QC filtering record doc, R script used for QC filtering, filtered genotypes in genalex, genind, and as dataframe.
## analyses_results: Analyses R script.
