# Ots_COQR_2023
## Objective: Use genotyping-in-thousands (GT-seq) to evaluate genetic diversity between natural origin (NOR) and hatchery origin (HOR) Chinook salmon sampled at Bandon Hatchery on the Coquille River, Oregon.
## Sampling: 312 fin clips (44 presumed NOR, 267 presumed HOR, 1 unknown origin) were sampled October - December 2023.
## Genotyped with the SFGL GT-seq SOP. Quality filtered according to SFGL SOP.
## Final Report: Olsen etal_2024_Coquille_Chinook_FINALV.pdf
## metadata: Phenotypic data and presumed HOR/NOR classification based on adipose fin clips.
## GT-seq_genotyping_output: initial outputs from GT-seq genotyping. marker info file and original genotypes.
## filtering_record_filtered_genotypes: QC filtering record doc, R script used for QC filtering, filtered genotypes as dataframe.
## analyses_results: Analyses R script.
